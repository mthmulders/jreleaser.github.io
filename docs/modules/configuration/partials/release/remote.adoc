== Git Remote

JReleaser assumes the default Git remote to be named `origin` however not everyone uses that name. Should you need to use
a different name you may define an environment variable named `JRELEASER_DEFAULT_GIT_REMOTE` whose value is the name
of the remote.

WARNING: You *must* use an environment variable, can not use external properties as explained in
xref:configuration:environment.adoc[].
